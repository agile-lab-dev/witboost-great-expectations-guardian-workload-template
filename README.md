# Great Expectations Guardian Workload Template

- [Overview](#overview)
- [Usage](#usage)

## Overview

Use this template to deploy a [Data Contract Guardian](https://docs.witboost.com/docs/p1_user/p12_data_contracts/p12_1_overview#data-contract-guardians) that performs Data Quality checks using Great Expectations framework. The checks will be triggered by an Airflow orchestrator, so be sure to also add Airflow component created using [Airflow Template](https://github.com/agile-lab-dev/witboost-mwaa-workload-template) to the System after this one.

Refer to the [Witboost Starter Kit repository](https://github.com/agile-lab-dev/witboost-starter-kit) for information on the Tech Adapter that can be used to deploy components created with this template.

### What's a Template?

A Template is a tool that helps create components inside a Data Mesh. Templates help establish a standard across the organization. This standard leads to easier understanding, management and maintenance of components. Templates provide a predefined structure so that developers don't have to start from scratch each time, which leads to faster development and allows them to focus on other aspects, such as testing and business logic.

For more information, please refer to the [official documentation](https://docs.witboost.agilelab.it/docs/p1_user/p6_advanced/p6_1_templates/#getting-started).

### What's a Workload?

Workload refers to any data processing step (ETL, job, transformation etc.) that is applied to data in a Data Product. Workloads can pull data from sources external to the Data Mesh or from an Output Port of a different Data Product or from Storage Areas inside the same Data Product, and persist it for further processing or serving.

### Great Expectations

Great Expectations (GX) is a framework for describing data using expressive tests and then validating that the data meets test criteria. GX Core is a Python library that provides a programmatic interface to building and running data validation workflows using GX.

Learn more about it on the [official website](https://docs.greatexpectations.io/docs/core/introduction/).
